# codeapp-js

JavaScript library, starter app, and sample apps for building Power Apps Code Apps with standard web technologies.

The repository is the primary source of truth for the project. The public site at [codeappjs.com](https://codeappjs.com) is useful for background and additional docs, but this repo reflects the latest files, examples, and starter assets.

## What this repo includes

- A deployable starter app in `codeApp/`
- Runtime files in `codeApp/dist/` including `codeapp.js`, `power-apps-data.js`, and connector assets
- Example apps for Dataverse, Outlook, SharePoint, Groups, and full app scenarios under `examples/`
- Connector schemas under `schemas/`
- AI instructions and skills used for code-first app generation under `AI/`

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Power Platform CLI (`pac`) for deployment
- A Power Platform environment with Code Apps enabled
- Optional: VS Code with Copilot and Power Platform Tools

No package install is required for local serving. The repo uses a built-in Node static server.

Run a static server for the repo:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open the starter code app directly:

```bash
npm run start:codeapp
```

The starter app lives in `codeApp/dist/` and is served without a build step.

## Starter app structure

The default starter app is in `codeApp/`.

- `codeApp/power.config.json`: Power Apps Code App configuration
- `codeApp/dist/index.html`: app shell and import map for `@microsoft/power-apps/data`
- `codeApp/dist/index.js`: starter boot file
- `codeApp/dist/codeapp.js`: helper runtime used by samples and generated apps
- `codeApp/dist/power-apps-data.js`: Power Apps data runtime bundle
- `codeApp/dist/connectors/`: generated connector support files

## Deploying a code app

1. Update `power.config.json` with your target environment details.
2. Authenticate with Power Platform CLI.
3. Push the app to your environment.

Example:

```bash
pac auth create --environment https://<yourorg>.crm.dynamics.com
pac env who
pac code push --solutionName MyCodeApp
```

The app packages the configured `buildPath` from `power.config.json`, which defaults to `./dist` in the included starter and examples.

## Examples

The `examples/` folder contains both focused demos and fuller application samples.

- `examples/dataverse Demo/`: Dataverse-focused sample
- `examples/groups Demo/`: Microsoft 365 Groups sample
- `examples/myProfile/`: Office 365 Users sample
- `examples/outlook Demo/`: Outlook mail and calendar sample
- `examples/sharepoint demo/`: SharePoint sample
- `examples/apps/kanban/`: fuller app example with generated source assets
- `examples/apps/planning Poker/`: planning poker app assets
- `examples/apps/solution explorer/`: solution explorer app assets
- `examples/apps/Solution Share/`: solution sharing sample
- `examples/apps/todo/`: todo app sample

Each sample includes its own `power.config.json`, and some include additional notes or agent artifacts.

## Working with connectors

Connector schemas for common services are stored in `schemas/`, and example-specific generated assets may appear under an app's `src/generated/` or `dist/connectors/` folders.

This repo includes patterns and examples for:

- Dataverse
- SharePoint
- Office 365 Outlook
- Office 365 Users
- Office 365 Groups
- Jira
- Teams
- SQL
- Key Vault
